# Preserve the timezone of the receiver when calling to `to_time`.
# Ruby 2.4 will change the behavior of `to_time` to preserve the timezone
# when converting to an instance of `Time` instead of the previous behavior
# of converting to the local system timezone.
#
# Rails 5.0 introduced this config option so that apps made with earlier
# versions of Rails are not affected when upgrading.
